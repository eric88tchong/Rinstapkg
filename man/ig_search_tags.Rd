\title{Search by Hashtag}
\usage{
ig_search_tags(hashtag, max_id = NULL, return_df = TRUE,
  paginate = TRUE, max_pages = 10, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{hashtag}{character; do not include the hashtag (pound sign) at the beginning 
of the string}

\item{max_id}{integer; the unique id identifying the oldest post that you 
would want to retrieve in this function call}

\item{return_df}{logical; do you want to return the results as a \code{tbl_df} 
with one row per entity or as a list with one element per entity?}

\item{paginate}{logical; do you want to paginate through results or just return 
the first page?}

\item{max_pages}{integer; a limit to the number of pages to retrieve from 
paginated endpoints. Instagram feeds have the potential to paginate forever, 
so by default we stop after pulling 10 pages. If you would like more or less 
pages returned, then modify this argument.}

\item{verbose}{logical; do you want informative messages?}
}
\description{
This function accepts a hashtag, without the "#" symbol and returns the similar 
hashtags. You can then use \link{ig_get_hashtag_feed} to return all posts associated 
with that hashtag.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# search for posts using the #belieber hashtag
belieber_posts <- ig_search_tags("belieber")
}
