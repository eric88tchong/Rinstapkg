**Rinstapkg** is an R package that connects to the Instagram API using tidy principles. 
Rinstapkg is short for the <b>R</b>eal <b>Insta</b>gram <b>P</b>ac<b>k</b>a<b>g</b>e. 
With this package you can like, comment, follow, and slide into some DMs just like the 
real Instagram. You can also get tons of feed data: user feeds, timeline feeds, location 
feeds and more! All this comes without the need to register for an application. 
Here are some of the package highlights:  

  * OAuth 2.0 (Single Sign On) and Basic (Username-Password) Authentication methods (`ig_auth()`)
  * Retrieve Feeds of different types:
    * `ig_my_timeline()`, `ig_get_user_feed()`, `ig_get_hashtag_feed()`, and more!
  * Retrieve Users, Tags, Comments, and Perform Searches: 
    * `ig_get_followers()`, `ig_get_user_tags()`, `ig_get_media_comments()`, `ig_search_users()`, etc.
  * Utility calls (`ig_change_password()`, `ig_sync_features()`)

**NOTE:** With great power comes great responsibility. Use of this package means 
that you will not use it to spam, harass, or perform other nefarious acts.

## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install from CRAN
install.packages("Rinstapkg")

# get the latest version available on GitHub using the devtools package
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("eric88tchong/Rinstapkg")
```

If you encounter a bug or issue, please file a minimal reproducible example on [GitHub](https://github.com/eric88tchong/Rinstapkg/issues).

## Usage

### Authenticate

First, load the **Rinstapkg** package and log in. There are two ways to authenticate:  

  1. OAuth 2.0
  2. Basic Username-Password

It is recommended to use OAuth 2.0 if you apply for and are approved for an Instagram 
App. This way multiple users can use your app without having to explicity share 
their credentials with you. If you do not have an approved app, you can still use this 
package by providing your username and password.

```{r auth, include = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(Rinstapkg)

# OAuth2.0 token authentication, which we won't use here
#token_path <- here::here("tests", "testthat", "Rinstapkg_token.rds")
#suppressMessages(ig_auth(token = token_path, verbose = FALSE))

# Username-Password authentication
settings <- readRDS(here::here("tests", "testthat", "Rinstapkg_test_settings.rds"))
ig_auth(username=settings$dev$username, password=settings$dev$password)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(Rinstapkg)

# Using OAuth 2.0 authentication
ig_auth()

# Using Basic Username-Password authentication
ig_auth(username = "YOUR_USERNAME_OR_EMAIL_HERE", 
        password = "YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE")
```

After logging in with `ig_auth()`, you can check your connectivity by looking at 
the information returned about your timeline (`ig_my_timeline()`), inbox (`ig_my_inbox()`), 
or recent activity (`ig_my_recent_activity()`). It should be information about you!

### Timeline Feed

A simple function to start with is verifying that you can retrieve your timeline as 
it would appear in the Instagramm app or online. This function returns data that 
would appear in the authenticated user's timeline feed. By default, the data is 
returned as a tidy `tbl_df` where each row represents one post from the feed. If 
you prefer to work with a list format, then just specify `return_df=FALSE` as an 
argument.

```{r timeline-feed}
timeline_results <- ig_my_timeline()
timeline_results
```

### Get Followers

With the `ig_get_followers()` function you can retrieve a `tbl_df` of all the users 
that follow a particular user. Just provide the `user_id` of the account whose followers 
you would like to get. **NOTE**: The Instagram APIs use Ids to retrieve information so 
instead of giving the account's username (typically starting with an \@symbol), you 
need to first grab the `user_id` of that account using the username, then supply it 
to the `ig_get_followers()` function. 

```{r get-followers-1}
# Get Justin's Biebers beliebers!
# Side Note: A belieber is a HUGE Justin Bieber fan.
bieber_user_id <- ig_get_user_id("justinbieber")
follower_results <- ig_get_followers(bieber_user_id)
follower_results
```

In the example above you'll notice that we didn't retrieve all 100M+ followers that 
Justin Bieber has. By default the function only returns the top 10 pages of followers, 
but you can set the `max_pages` argument equal to `Inf` to return all of them. Caution: 
This might take awhile!

```{r get-followers-2, eval=FALSE}
# return all 100M+ followers of Justin Bieber
follower_results <- ig_get_followers(bieber_user_id, max_pages = Inf)
```

### Get Following

With the `ig_get_following()` function you can retrieve a `tbl_df` of all the users 
that a particular user is following. For example, Justin Bieber follows ~100 users. Who 
are those lucky few?

```{r get-following}
following_results <- ig_get_following(bieber_user_id)
following_results
```

## Future

Future methods to support: 

 - Profile Functions: 
     - `ig_profile_picture_change()`
     - `ig_profile_picture_remove()`
     - `ig_profile_set_private()`
     - `ig_profile_set_public()`
     - `ig_profile_get()`
     - `ig_profile_edit()`
     - `ig_remove_self_tag()`
     - `ig_approve_friendship()`
     - `ig_ignore_friendship()`
     - `ig_ignore_friendship()`
 - Creation Functions: 
     - `ig_upload_photo()`
     - `ig_upload_video()`
     - `ig_upload_album()`
 - More In-App Functions
     - `ig_direct_message()`
     - `ig_direct_share()`
     - `ig_follow()`
     - `ig_unfollow()`
     - `ig_block()`
     - `ig_unblock()`

## Credits

This application uses other open source software components. The authentication 
components are mostly verbatim copies of the routines established in the **googlesheets** 
package (https://github.com/jennybc/googlesheets). Methods are inspired by the 
**Instagram-API-python** library (https://github.com/LevPasha/Instagram-API-python) and 
**Instagram-API** library (https://github.com/mgp25/Instagram-API). We acknowledge 
and are grateful to these developers for their contributions to open source.  

## More Information

Use of this package means that you will not use it to spam, harass, or perform 
other nefarious acts. For more details on how to use the API please see this
